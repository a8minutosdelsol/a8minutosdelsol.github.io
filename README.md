## About me
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at PUC Chile. During 2020-2021 I was a Krener Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at University of Calirnia, Davis. I received my PhD in 2019 from Universidad Andres Bello. 


## Research
I'm broadly interested in gravity and holography. Recently, I've also become interested in the theory of spin glasses, the renormalization group and critical phenomena.
