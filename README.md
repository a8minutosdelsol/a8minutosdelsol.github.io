## About me
I'm a theoretical physicist currently working as a postdoc at the Department of Mathematics of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. 


## Research
I'm broadly interested in gravity and holography. More recently, I've also become interested in the theory of spin glasses, the renormalization group and critical phenomena.


## Teaching 
I devote some of my time to teaching activities...
