## About me
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at PUC Chile. During 2020-2021 I was a Krener Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at University of Calirnia, Davis. I received my PhD in 2019 from Universidad Andres Bello under the supervision of Per Sundell. 


## Research
I'm broadly interested in gravity and holography. More recently, I've also become interested in the theory of spin glasses, the renormalization group and critical phenomena.
