## About me
I'm a theoretical physicist currently working as a postdoc at the Department of Mathematics of Universidad Catolica de Chile. 


## Research
I'm broadly interested in gravity and holography. I've also become recently interested in the theory of spin glasses, the renormalization group and critical phenomena; it's cool stuff!


## Teaching 
I devote some of my time to teaching activities...
